# Diner Decider
An app to help you and your friends decide where to get food.

## Login
The app supports anonymous, facebook, and google login. Anonymous login is a one click login and is the easiest way to access the app. Facebook and Google login will allow you to enter the app after signing into those respective accounts. *Note: Facebook login requires you to be listed as a tester of the app.

## Create Room View
In the create room view, you specify the room name, password, how many hunger bucks each user will receive, and distance from your current location. *Note: In the future you will be able to specify a radius based on a custom location and not your current location. There will also be more filter options to fine tune the restaurants your group will be allowed to choose from.
